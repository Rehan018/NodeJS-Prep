body-parser is a middleware for Express.js that parses the body of incoming HTTP requests. 
When a client sends data to the server, it can be in various formats such as JSON,
URL-encoded, or multipart form data. body-parser simplifies the process of extracting 
this data from the request and makes it available in a convenient way for your Express.js application to use.

Here are some common use cases for body-parser:

Parsing Form Data: When a client submits an HTML form on a website,
the data is typically sent as URL-encoded form data. body-parser can parse this data and make it available in the req.body object.

const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));



2.Parsing JSON Data: Nowadays, many applications send data in JSON format. body-parser can parse JSON data and make it available in the req.body object.



const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.json());



3.Parsing Multipart Data: If your application handles file uploads, body-parser can also parse multipart/form-data, making it easier to work with files that are included in the request.





const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.multipart());


By using body-parser, you can abstract away the details of parsing different types of data from the request,
allowing you to focus on handling the processed data in your routes and controllers. It's important to note
that starting with Express.js version 4.16.0, the express module includes express.json() and express.urlencoded()
middleware, making it unnecessary to separately install and configure body-parser for JSON and URL-encoded data
in the latest versions of Express.




const express = require('express');

const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();



app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));



app.get('/add-product', (req, res, next) => {

    console.log("Displaying add-product form");

    res.send('<form action="/product" method="POST">' +

        '<input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Product Title"><br>' +

        '<input type="text" name="size" placeholder="Product Size"><br>' +

        '<button type="submit">Add Product</button>' +

        '</form>');

});



app.post('/product', (req, res, next) => {

    const productTitle = req.body.title;

    const productSize = req.body.size;



    console.log('Product Title:', productTitle);

    console.log('Product Size:', productSize);



    // You can do further processing or store the data in a database here



    res.redirect('/');

});



app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {

    console.log("Displaying home page");

    res.send('<h1>Hi, My Name Is Rehan!</h1>');

});



app.listen(3001, () => {

    console.log('Server is running on port 3001');

});
